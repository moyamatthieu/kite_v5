        With this software you can study the physics and math which describe the
        flight of a
        <a href="kite1.html">kite</a>.
        You can choose from several types of kites and change the shape, size, and materials
        to produce your own design.
        You can change the values of different variables which affect the design
        and immediately see the new
         <a href="kitefly.html">flight</a> characteristics.
        With this version of the program, you can even test how your kite
        would fly on Mars, or off the top of a mountain.
        The program tells you if your design is
         <a href="kitestab.html">stable</a>
        or not and
        also computes a prediction of how
         <a href="kitesag.html">high</a>
        your kite will fly.

          are given in <a href="#GRAPHICS">GRAPHICS</a>.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the <b>right</b>
          of the screen at the <b>bottom</b> is the control and output panel.
          You can select the "Design", "Trim","Fly", or "Output" mode by clicking on the
          buttons at the top of the panel.
          The selected mode is indicated by a yellow button.
          Depending on your choice, different input panels appear at the
          top of the program and different output variables  are shown at the bottom.
          Output boxes are shown with a black background, input boxes with
          a white background.
          Details of the <a href="#INPUT VARIABLES">INPUT</a>
          and <a href="#OUTPUT VARIABLES">OUTPUT</a> variables are given below.
          If you click the "Output", a large text window
          is displayed at the upper right. Output can be saved to this window by
          using the <b>Print</b>
          button on the view window at the lower left.

        The <b>View</b> window for the kite is shown on the left of the program screen.
        You can change the size of the image by using the slider at the far left. Just
        click and drag on the black bar to make the image larger or smaller.
        If your kite design or trim is,
         <a href="kitestab.html">unstable</a>
        a red and yellow banner appears
        over the graphics. You should then change either a

         units are the default.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can move the kite within the view window by moving your cursor into the window,
        holding down the left mouse button, and dragging the kite to a new location. If you
        lose the kite, click on the <b>Find</b> button above the slider.
       </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        There are three views available to the user; Front, Side, and Field, as
        indicated by the buttons at the top of the window.
        The selected button is indicated by a yellow background.
        By default, the Front view is shown in Design Mode, the Side view
        in Trim Mode, and the Field view in Fly Mode.
        However, you can override the default by using the "Select View->" button.
        Click on this button, then click on the desired view. You can use any view
        at any time in the design, trim, and flight sequence as long as the "Select View->" button
        is yellow. To return to the default views, just click on the "Select View->" button again.

      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Front</b> shows
          the kite as viewed looking perpendicular to the surface. This view is
          the default during the "Design" of your kite. The geometric input
          parameters are shown to the right and below the kite drawing.
         <a href="kitepart.html">Surfaces</a>
          are shown as white areas, while the frame is shown as black lines.
          The
         <a href="kitecg.html">center of gravity</a>
          is shown as a red dot and the
         <a href="kitecp.html">center of pressure</a>
          as a green dot. The tail of the kite is given as a green line at the
          bottom.

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Side</b> shows
          the kite as viewed looking along the surface. This view is
          the default during the
         <a href="kitetrim.html">"Trim"</a>
          phase of your kite.
          The wind is blowing
          over the kite from left to right and the
         <a href="vel.html">magnitude</a>
          of the wind is
          shown by a small green arrow at the bottom.
          The kite surface is again shown as a white area, and the tail as a cyan
          line at the right. The length of the tail (T) is set on the trim input panel.
          The kite surface is inclined to the horizontal at the
         <a href="kiteincl.html">angle of attack</a>
          of the kite.
          The
         <a href="kitegeom.html">bridle</a>
          of the kite is given by the white line below
          the kite surface. The bridle length (B) is set on the Trim input panel.
          The
         <a href="kiteline.html">control line</a>
          is shown by a magenta line from the lower left.
          The control line is attached to the bridle at the
         <a href="kitebrid.html">bridle point (knot)</a>
          shown as a white dot.  The distance of the knot from the base of the
          kite is denoted by (K) and is shown as a yellow line below the bridle.
          This distance is also set on the trim input panel.
          This drawing changes as you trim the kite by changing the length of the
          bridle or the location of the knot.
          The
         <a href="kitelift.html">lift</a>,
         <a href="kitedrag.html">drag</a>, and
         <a href="kitewt.html">weight</a>
          forces that are acting on the kite
          during flight are displayed as vectors (arrows) with the lengths
          proportional to one another. You can change the length of all the force
          vectors by using the "Scale" slider at the bottom of the window.
         </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Field</b> shows
          the kite flying with the control line running from you to the kite. This view is
          recommended during the "Flight" phase of your kite.
          As before, the wind blows from left to right over the kite.
          A white line shows the length and shape of the control line. (Notice that the
          line
         <a href="kitesag.html">sags</a>
          under its own weight and may even touch the ground.) The kite flies
          at some distance "X" from your feet and at some height "Y" above the ground.
          The values of these variables are shown on the output panel.
          If you let out line, the kite may leave the view window. You can change the
          size of the display by using the "Scale" slide at the bottom.

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="OUTPUT VARIABLES"></a><b>OUTPUT
        VARIABLES</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Output variables are displayed at the top right of the program screen.
        In most cases, these output variables are calculated by the computer program
        using mathematical equations. We have created <b>hyperlinks</b> to other web pages
        which describe the exact equations used in this program. Just click on the variable
        listed below to view these equations.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the "Design" or "Trim" mode is chosen, the following variables are displayed.
        The
         <a href="kitewt.html">Weight</a>
        of the kite is calculated based on the input geometry and
        the materials selected. The weight is displayed in ounces or gram-weights and
        does not include the weight of the control line.
        The aerodynamic
         <a href="kitelift.html">Lift</a> and
         <a href="kitedrag.html">Drag</a>
         are computed by the program and displayed in ounces or gram-weights.
         The
         <a href="kitefor.html">Tension</a>
         in the line is displayed in ounces or grams. This is computed based on the
         forces on the kite and the weight of the line.
         The
         <a href="kitecg.html">Center of Gravity (Cg)</a> and
         <a href="kitecp.html">Center of Pressure (Cp)</a>
         are the average location of the weight and aerodynamics forces, respectively.
         They are computed by the program in inches or centimeters from the bottom of the kite
         as shown in the "Front" view.
         The
         <a href="geom.html">Surface Area</a>
         of all the material and the length of all the components of the
         <a href="kitepart.html">Frame</a>
         needed to make your kite
         are computed based on your geometric input and the type of kite selected.
         These values are used in the computation of the weight and Cg.
         The  trimmed
         <a href="kiteincl.html">Angle</a>
         of attack is displayed in degrees and
         may be either input by the user or calculated by the program.
         If the value is calculated by the program, the output numerals are
         green and the value is calculated to eliminate any torque on the kite.
         If the value is input, the output numerals are yellow
         to warn the user that the resulting flight conditions may be unstable.
         The program calculates the net
         <a href="kitetrim.html">Torque</a>
         on the kite about the bridle point. In stable flight the value is zero (in this
         program it is computed to a very small but non-zero number).
         The units for torque are ounces-inch.
         Using the "Side" view of the kite, a positive torque is clockwise and a
         negative torque is counter-clockwise about the bridle point.
       </p>
       <p>
         If the "Fly" mode is selected, four additional variables are displayed.
         The
         <a href="kitesag.html">Range-X</a>
         is the horizontal distance of the kite from your location during
         flight. This value is related to the Height-Y and is also displayed on
         the "Field" view.
         The
         <a href="kitesag.html">Height-Y</a>
         is the predicted altitude at which your kite flies. This value depends
         on the flight characteristics of the kite, the wind velocity, the atmospheric
         conditions, and the
         amount of control line that you use. The value is computed in feet or meters and
         is shown on the "Field" view.
         The atmospheric
         <a href="pressure.html">pressure</a>
         is displayed in pounds per square inch (psi) or or kilo-Pascals (kPa) and
         depends on the altitude and planet chosen on the input panel.
         The atmospheric
         <a href="temptr.html">temperature</a>
         is also displayed in degrees Fahrenheit (F) or Celsius (C).

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="INPUT VARIABLES"></a><b>INPUT
        VARIABLES</b></font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Input variables are displayed on input panels at the upper right of the screen.
          There are four sets of input variables which depend on the program mode.
       <ol>
       <li> In the "Design" mode, the default input panel is the <b>Shape</b> panel.
            On the Shape panel you first select the type of kite to be designed
            by using the drop menu at the upper right. You can choose from five
         <a href="kite1.html">basic designs</a>.
            Depending on the design, you then vary the height,
         <a href="kitegeom.html">H1 and H2</a>,
            and width parameters,
         <a href="kitegeom.html">W1 and W2</a>,
           to alter the shape of your kite.
            The "Front" view shows the meaning of these variables and also indicates if your
            design is unstable.
            There are default geometries for each kite based on the width <b>W1</b>. If you
            change the type of kite, you will get the new kite default with the current
            value of W1 held constant. Pushing the <b>Reset</b> button on the view panel
            will return the default geometry with W1 = 10 inches.
        </li>
        <li> In the "Design" mode, you can also change the material properties of all
             of the parts of your kite. Push the white
             "Material" button to display the
             <b>Material</b> input panel.
             On the Material panel you change the material used for the <b>Surfaces</b>, <b>Frame</b>,
             <b>Tail</b>,
             and control <b>Line</b> by using the drop menu at the far right of each part.
             Each material has a characteristic
         <a href="kitewt.html">"density"</a>
             which is displayed in the black output
             box. This density is used to compute the weight and Cg of your kite and the
             sag of the control line. For each part you
             can <b>Specify</b> your own material density by making this selection on the drop
             menu. The black output box then becomes a white input box and you can enter your own
             data as described above.
             You can use the <b>Max Dimension</b> input box to change the size of your kite. The
             max dimension is used on the height, width, and bridle input sliders and boxes.
             You can use this parameter to design very large or very small kites.
          </li>
          <li>
             In the "Trim" mode, the default input panel is the <b>Trim</b> panel.
             On the Trim panel you can select to have the program
         <a href="kitetrim.html">compute</a>
             the trimmed angle
             of attack or your can input your own flight angle of attack
             by using the
             drop menu at the upper right. If you decide to input your angle of attack,
             you then input the
         <a href="kiteincl.html">Angle</a>
             in degrees. The "Side" view shows the inclination
             of your kite relative to the wind. The most important variables used to trim
             your kite are the
         <a href="kitebrid.html">Bridle</a> and
         <a href="kitebrid.html">Knot</a>
             variables. Bridle gives the
             total length of the bridle string in inches or centimeters. Knot gives the length along the
             bridle string from the base of the kite to the attachment of the control line.
             These two variables affect the trim angle of the kite which affects the magnitude
             of the aerodynamic forces. Because the kite pivots about the knot in flight, the
             location of the knot has a large effect on the stability of the kite.
             The length of the <b>Tail</b> also affects stability and trim by shifting the Cg.
           </li>
           <li>
             In the "Fly" mode, you may choose to fly your kite on
             Earth or on Mars by using the menu button at the right.
             The gravitational constant on Mars is different than the earth, so you
             will notice that the weight of your kite changes. (The material densities
             and payload weight are still based on "earth" values).
             You can set the altitude in feet or meters which changes the
             atmospheric pressure and temperature using an
         <a href="atmosi.html">atmospheric model</a>.
             You can set the
         <a href="vel.html">Wind</a>
             speed in feet or meters per second and the
             length of the control
         <a href="kiteline.html">Line</a>
             in feet or meters. The weight of the control line is
             calculated and causes the line to sag as shown in the "Field" view. Eventually
             a point is reached where the line touches the ground at your feet. The program
             then ignores any additional line input that you make.
            You can also attach a payload to your kite at the center of gravity using
             the input box and slider at the bottom of the panel.

  <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p>
  <p>The Educational Programs Office will continue to improve and update KiteModeler
     based on user input. Changes from previous versions of the program include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>On <b>28 Aug 12</b>, version 1.5a was released. This version includes
        the max dimension variable on the Materials input panel. This allows for
        the design of very large kites, as requested by users of the program. We
        have also re-arranged the input panels and the color of some buttons to
        be consistent with other simulators at the Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics.
     </li>

    <li>On <b>14 May 12</b>, version 1.4c was released. This version includes
        some minor fixups on the displays and labels.
     </li>
    <li>On <b>3 Nov 04</b>, version 1.4b was released. This version includes
        the "Tumbleweed" kite design which was requested by NASA Langley in
        support of a study of a passive Mars rover design. The layout of the
        program was modified and the planet, altitude, and payload inputs were
        added.
     </li>
    <li>On <b>25 Sep 03</b>, version 1.3b was released. This version includes
        the "Twin Trap" kite design which was requested for a NASA Connect
        broadcast concerning the Centennial of Flight.
     </li>
    <li>On <b>1 Oct 02</b>, version 1.3 was released. This version includes
        the output text field at the bottom of the program, the default geometries
        for all the kites, the Reset feature, the line tension output,
        and a fixed bug in the line weight.
     </li>
    <li>On <b>29 July 02</b>, version 1.2 was released. This version includes
       English and Metric units and the Twin-Trap kite geometry.
     </li>
    <li>On <b>28 Mar 02</b>, version 1.1 was released.
     </li>
