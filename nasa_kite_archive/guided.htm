<p> The <A HREF="index.html">Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics</A> (BGA) was created
  as a Web-based "textbook.&quot; The creation of the BGA is a research project
  to explore the use of the personal computer and the Internet to present educational
  materials to students, teachers, and lifelong learners in a more interactive
  way than a printed, bound textbook.</p>
<p> As a general rule, the Web consists of many individual <b>pages</b> that are
  connected, or related, to one another through <b>hyperlinks</b>. The Web is,
  therefore, much less structured than a bound book, in which one page follows
  another in a definite, numbered sequence. We have intentionally organized the
  BGA to mirror this unstructured approach. Users can <b>navigate </b>the pages
  of the BGA through hyperlinks based on their own interest and inquiry. </p>
<p> For those who prefer more structure to the information available at the BGA,
  we have organized an alternative to the unstructured approach--a number of <b>guided
  tours</b> through the site. Each tour is organized around a single topic, and
  users move from page to page through the tour by using special buttons at the
  bottom of each page. </p>

  to remember which tour you are on. If you click on a hyperlink you will leave
  the tour; you can rejoin the tour by using the browser's "<b>Back</b>" command.

  <li><b><a href="newton2.html">Forces, Torques, and Motion</a></b> As an object
    moves through space it translates and rotates. The translations are in direct
    response to forces on the object. The rotations are in response to torques
    on the object. </li>
  <li><b><a href="thermo.html">Thermodynamics</a></b> Thermodynamics is the study
    of the effects of work, heat and energy on a system. There are three laws of
