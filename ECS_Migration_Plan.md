# ECS Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to refactor the Kite Simulator project into a well-architected Entity Component System (ECS) framework. The goal is to ensure a clean, efficient, and scalable architecture while preserving all existing features and functionality.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Refactor Components
- **Objective**: Ensure all components are modular, reusable, and aligned with ECS principles.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review existing components (e.g., `TransformComponent`, `MeshComponent`).
  - Standardize component interfaces and data structures.
  - Remove redundant or legacy code.

### 2. Refactor Entities
- **Objective**: Properly structure entities and register them in the `EntityManager`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Migrate entities to the ECS framework (e.g., `ControlBarEntity`, `KiteEntity`).
  - Ensure entities are lightweight and only contain references to components.
  - Validate entity creation and destruction workflows.

### 3. Refactor Systems
- **Objective**: Align systems with the ECS lifecycle and optimize for performance.
- **Tasks**:
  - Refactor systems to operate on entities with specific component combinations.
  - Ensure systems follow the ECS lifecycle (`initialize`, `update`, `reset`, `dispose`).
  - Optimize system execution order and dependencies.

### 4. Migrate Legacy Code
- **Objective**: Integrate legacy code into the ECS framework without losing functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Identify legacy code that needs migration (e.g., `KiteController`).
  - Refactor code to fit within the ECS architecture.
  - Test migrated code to ensure feature parity.

### 5. Clean Up Project
- **Objective**: Remove redundant or obsolete elements to establish a cohesive codebase.
- **Tasks**:
  - Identify and remove unused files, classes, and functions.
  - Standardize file and folder structure.
  - Ensure consistent coding style and documentation.

### 6. Update Documentation
- **Objective**: Reflect the new ECS architecture and file structure in the documentation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Update `copilot-instructions.md` with the new architecture.
  - Document all components, entities, and systems.
  - Provide examples and usage guidelines.

### 7. Validate Migration
- **Objective**: Ensure all features work as expected after the migration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Run automated tests (e.g., `npm run test-ecs`).
  - Perform manual testing to validate functionality.
  - Fix any issues that arise during testing.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Refactor components and entities.
- **Week 2**: Refactor systems and migrate legacy code.
- **Week 3**: Clean up the project and update documentation.
- **Week 4**: Validate migration and finalize.

## Notes
- Follow the principles outlined in `copilot-instructions.md`.
- Use the `EntityManager` to manage all entities.
- Ensure all systems operate on entities with specific component combinations.
- Prioritize clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
